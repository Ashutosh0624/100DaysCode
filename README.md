# 🚀 100 Days of Code Challenge

## **📌 Overview**
Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** challenge! 🎯 

For the next **100 days**, I will be coding every day in **C++, Python, and Rust**, focusing on:
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**
- **Machine Learning Concepts**
- **Rust Programming & Implementation**
- **Operating System Concepts**
- **SQL Practice**

This repository will track my daily progress, learning experiences, and coding implementations. 📝💻

## **📌 Progress Log**
I will maintain a **progress log** documenting what I learned and coded each day.

- **Day 1:** Implemented Binary Search, trained a simple Neural Network, learned Rust ownership.
- **Day 2:** Worked on Graph algorithms, implemented Decision Trees, explored process scheduling.
- ...

Full progress: [progress_log.md](progress_log.md)
